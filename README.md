My very own TwitterBot, v1. :D

Can currently do the following things:
Save any user's tweets to a file
Search a string against a user's tweets
Check if a user has posted any new tweets
Get a the ID of a user's newest tweet
Post a status
Post a status from a file

Note: If, for some odd reason, you can obtain my login credentials from this repository...
Please don't mess with my twitter. Email me instead.

Thanks!
Zach
